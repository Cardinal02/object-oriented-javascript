//1. Create a Class called WhyClass.  This class should have one property, and two methods.  THe property is called "purpose", and stores a string.  This string should clearly explain why classes are used in Object Oriented Programming.  The first method is called explain().  This method should print the contents stored in the purpose 'field' of the class.  The second method is called pieces().  This 2nd method should print out the various parts that are essential to building a class.  Instantiate the class, and invoke the method so the results are showing in the console once this file is run.

/*********************************************** 
Bonus Exercises:

//4. Create three more instances of the Shape class for a pentagon, hexagon, and an octagon.  Add in  comments explaining the formulas for calculating the perimeter and the areas of these 3 shapes.  Also, as noted above, if you use the formula to calculate the height of the triangle instead of hard coding it, you will also obtain the bonus for this exercise.  The dimensions for the triangle are already provided for you in the triangle object literal.
